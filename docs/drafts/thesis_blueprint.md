# Thesis Blueprint: The Condensation of Distributed Intelligence

**Title Proposal:** " Echoes of Error: Phase Transition and Pathological Condensation in LLM Multi-Agent Deliberation"

## Section Breakdown & Estimates

### 1. Abstract (1 Page)

- Concise summary of the "Condensation" hypothesis.
- High-level methodology and key finding: Logic (C4) as a catalyst for systemic collapse.

### 2. Introduction (2-3 Pages)

- **Problem:** The push for AGI and the danger of "Information Monoculture."
- **Context:** Previous LLM collapse research vs. our "Social/Multi-Agent" focus.
- **Thesis Statement:** Multi-agent intelligence requires "Fermionic Tension" to avoid pathological condensation.

### 3. Theoretical Framework (4-5 Pages)

- **The Physics of Thought:** Translating your "Essai" into academic terms.
- **Key Concepts:**
  - Agents as **Fermions** (Pauli Exclusion Principle of unique stances).
  - Rationales as **Phonons** (Information-carrying waves).
  - **Bose-Einstein Condensation** as a metaphor for systemic bias and collapse.
- **Hypothesis:** Explicit logic sharing (C4) creates a "Resonance" that destroys diversity faster than social pressure (C1).

### 4. Methodology & Experimental Design (4 Pages)

- **Control Conditions:** Mandatory inclusion of C0 (Baseline) vs C1-C4.
- **Scientific Rigor:**
  - **Sample Size:** Target N=30 per condition, validated by Confidence Interval (CI) convergence.
  - **Manipulation Check:** Explicit verification of 15:15 perception in Round 1.
- **Scale:** Total ~150 runs (including controls) to exceed standard reliability thresholds.

### 5. Results (6-8 Pages)

- **Entropy Dynamics:** Visualizing the "Phase Transition."
- **Time-to-Collapse (TTC):** Statistical comparison between conditions.
- **Driver Decomposition:** Proving the "Logic Paradox" (Agents claiming rational change while actually conforming).

### 6. Discussion (4-6 Pages)

- **The ASI Risk:** Why superhuman intelligence doesn't solve this (and might accelerate it).
- **The "Is-Ought Jump":** How value judgments cannot be optimized via consensus.
- **Systemic Immunity:** The necessity of "Antagonistic Rationales."

### 7. Conclusion & References (2-3 Pages)

- Summary and future roadmap for "Diverse AGI Architecture."

**Total Estimated Length:** 20 - 25 Pages (Main Body)
